# OpentronsCovid19
Protocols written by DTU biosustain staff to use Opentrons robots for testing of Covid-19. Based in part on the initial setup described by
opentrons (see: https://blog.opentrons.com/how-opencell-is-scaling-up-covid-19-testing/). 

Protocols for reformatting of sample tubes into 96 well plates (Station A) and preparing for qPCR (Station C) are included.
